# Human Computer Interaction

This repository hosts the semester project in the course of Human Computer Interaction (7th Semester, ECE - NTUA). The topic of the project was to design a mobile application of our choice that can be useful in daily life. Our idea was to build a demo application (called 'Passful') with which one can use their credit card as a public transport ticket and recharge it easily at any time. Thanks to Passful, the credit card linked to the app can also be scanned inside the station using NFC for opening the gates. We used Figma for the prototyping and Flutter for the code implementation.
